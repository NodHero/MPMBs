// At a young age a travelling monk requested from your parents that you travel with him, during this time you and your master's tasks were to gather information from the outside world and bring supplies back to support your local monastery.  During these trips your master would instruct you on the local customs and history of the surrounding lands near your monastery.  You trained with your brothers and sisters in the temple whenever given the opportunity but mostly accompanied your master and almost all of your training came directly from his or her teachings.
