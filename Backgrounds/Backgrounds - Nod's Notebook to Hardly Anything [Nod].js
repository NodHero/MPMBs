/* Inquisitor Background
Historically, inquisitors were church detectives who investigated crimes both mundane and supernatural. They
were known for traveling to remote parishes plagued by unexplained murders, and for exposing werewolves living among normal humans. During darker times, the inquisitors led a series of brutal forays into unsuspecting villages. They executed suspected lycanthropes with little or no proof, and punished accused heretics in unsanctioned trials. This savage form of inquisition has become the norm, and inquisitors who still pry into dark mysteries have become a minority.
Skill Proficiencies: Investigation, Religion
Tool Proficiencies: Thieves’ tools, one set of artisan’s tools of your choice
Equipment: A holy symbol, a set of traveler’s clothes, and a belt pouch containing 15 gp
Feature: Legal Authority

/* Wild Blood
You grew up in the wilds, far from civilization and the comforts of town and technology. Part of a savage society that clings desperately to the Old Ways, the wilds are in your blood—attuned to nature, full of primal rage, and given short shrift by a world consumed with continuing civilization's march of progress. You found quiet, solitude, and perhaps deeper spiritual communion with the wild world. In your time apart from the clamor of society, you've witnessed the migration of herds larger than forests, survived weather more extreme than any city-dweller could comprehend, and enjoyed the solitude of being the only thinking creature for miles in any direction. */
