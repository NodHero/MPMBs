/* Wild Blood
You grew up in the wilds, far from civilization and the comforts of town and technology. Part of a savage society that clings desperately to the Old Ways, the wilds are in your bloodâ€”attuned to nature, full of primal rage, and given short shrift by a world consumed with continuing civilization's march of progress. You found quiet, solitude, and perhaps deeper spiritual communion with the wild world. In your time apart from the clamor of society, you've witnessed the migration of herds larger than forests, survived weather more extreme than any city-dweller could comprehend, and enjoyed the solitude of being the only thinking creature for miles in any direction. */
