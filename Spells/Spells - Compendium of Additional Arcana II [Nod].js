You coax a toadstool ring to sprout from the ground. A creature of your choice can sit in the center of the ring and meditate for the duration, catching glimpses of the past, present, and future. The creature can ask up to three questions: one about the past, one about the present, and one about the future. The GM offers truthful answers in the form of dreamlike visions that may be subject to interpretation. The spell doesn't take into account any possible circumstances that might change the outcome, such as the casting of additional spells or the loss or gain of a companion. When the spell ends, the toadstools turn black and dissolve back into the earth.

If you cast the spell two or more times before finishing your next long rest, there is a cumulative 25 percent chance for each casting after the first that the meditating creature gets a random vision unrelated to the question. The GM makes this roll in secret.
