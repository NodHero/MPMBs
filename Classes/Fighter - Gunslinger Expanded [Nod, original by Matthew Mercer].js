/*	-INFORMATION-
	Subject:	Subclass
	Effect:		This script adds a subclass for the Fighter, called "Gunslinger Expanded"
				This script also adds the weapons and ammo associated with that subclass
	The original subclass this expanded version is based upon (Gunslinger v 1.3 by Matthew Mercer)
	is taken from the DMs Guild website (http://www.dmsguild.com/product/170778/)
	Please support the creator of this content (Matthew Mercer) and download his material from the DMs Guild website: http://www.dmsguild.com/browse.php?x=0&y=0&author=Matthew%20Mercer
	Note that you can't include both the v1.2 and v1.3 of the Gunslinger, because then the sheet will always use the latest version!
	The weights for the bullets are added by MorePurpleMoreBetter, as none are given in the original document
