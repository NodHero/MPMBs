// This file adds the Time Domain from reddit (https://www.reddit.com/r/UnearthedArcana/comments/3nb6ee/5e_cleric_subclass_time_domain/) as requested by u/aliensrule528194

/* The Time domain focuses on the unending passage of time â€“ one of the most powerful forces 
in the universe. Gods and Goddesses of time see every passing season, year, and lifetime. 
They control the cycles of life and death, and ultimately determine the fate of all peoples. 
Few deities are part of this domain, but there are a few notable ones, such as Savras or Istus. 
Clerics of a god of time are given godly insight and powerful chronomancy, which they use to 
protect and bring justice to the people of the world. */
